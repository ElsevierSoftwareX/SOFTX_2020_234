Description

SentinAir is a device designed and developed for data acquisition from diverse types of instruments, sensors or devices. Through this tool, you can acquire data from devices that you can plug into SentinAir system by USB, Ethernet, serial, SPI, or I2C ports. This system is useful especially in activities performed far from the laboratory facilities. The minimum requirement necessary to use the SentinAir device is a 220 Volt a.c. power source. The system can be controlled by the remote through internet wireless connections or through the Wi-Fi LAN set up by the SentinAir device as soon as it starts up. You can use SentinAir, for exaample, as a portable monitoring unit for air pollutant concentration detection; or, for evaluating device, instrument and sensor performances. By clicking on the pictures below you can see an explanatory video about the SentinAir use. You can find detailed information about how to set up and use SentinAir in the user guide released in the folder "guide".
I hope it will be useful to you.
