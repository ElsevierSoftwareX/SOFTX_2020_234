Description

SentinAir is a device designed and developed for data acquisition from any type of instruments, sensors or devices. The brain of the system is the Raspberry 3 B+ board, therefore the software presented here can be installed either on a SentinAir device, or on a Raspberry 3 B+ board. Devices can be plugged into SentinAir by USB, Ethernet, serial, SPI, or I2C port. The system is based on command line interfaces, except for the web pages served by the web server installed inside.

I hope it will be useful to you
