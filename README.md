# Description

SentinAir is a device designed and developed for data acquisition from diverse types of instruments, sensors or devices. Through this tool, you can acquire data from devices that you can plug into SentinAir system by USB, Ethernet, serial, SPI, or I2C ports. This system is useful especially in activities performed far from the laboratory facilities. The minimum requirement necessary to use the SentinAir device is a 220 Volt a.c. power source. The system can be controlled from the remote through internet wireless connections or through the Wi-Fi LAN set up by the SentinAir device as soon as it starts up. You can use SentinAir, for example, as a portable monitoring unit for air pollutant concentration detection; or, for evaluating device, instrument and sensor performances. By clicking on the pictures below you can see an explanatory video about the SentinAir use. You can find detailed information about how to set up and use SentinAir in the [user guide](https://github.com/domenico-suriano/SentinAir/blob/master/guide/sentinair-system-user-guide.pdf) released in the "guide" folder of this repository. The description of the SentinAir system and its use are shown in two scientific articles: [SentinAir system software: A flexible tool for data acquisition from heterogeneous sensors and devices](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100589) published on "SoftwareX" by Elsevier, and [Design and Development of a Flexible, Plug-and-Play, Cost-Effective Tool for on-Field Evaluation of Gas Sensors](https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8812025) published on "Journal of Sensors" by Hindawi.
I hope it will be useful to you.

# SentinAir software quick installation
This is a quick procedure to install the SentinAir software making the minimum steps. If you desire a higher level of customization, you can refer to the “SentinAir software installation” chapter of the [user guide](https://github.com/domenico-suriano/SentinAir/blob/master/guide/sentinair-system-user-guide.pdf) released in this repository. To install SentinAir, download the [last SentinAir SD card image file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AfPUjvr3tC3ymnK-TsBThjoi5kFb1ZuD/view?usp=sharing) (file size of 546 Mb), unzip the file, then write it in a SD card having at least 2 GB of memory space by using, for example, Win32diskimage.exe program (for Windows operative systems).

# Using SentinAir
To use the SentinAir system, please, refer to the [user guide](https://github.com/domenico-suriano/SentinAir/blob/master/guide/sentinair-system-user-guide.pdf) released in this repository. An overview of the SentinAir system use is shown in the video you can see by clicking on the pictures below.
